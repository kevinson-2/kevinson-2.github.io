        <h1 class="title">Hello folks / fellows / gamers,</h1>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          My name is Kevin Song. I'm a senior at Carnegie Mellon University, <br>
          studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-info">
          Fun Fact: I used to have a Sonic Arts minor, but I dropped that because: <br>
          1) I wanted to have a lighter course load for my last 1.5 years of college, <br>
          2) I was getting tired of buying blue paint.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          So far, I'm hoping to pursue a career in hardware design, <br> 
          but I'm still exploring the subfields of EE. <br>
          I really like PCB design, but I also like using SystemVerilog 
          (the best and worst thing to ever exist) 
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-info">
          Fun Fact: Apart from engineering, I enjoy video games, soccer, and listening.
        </p>
        <p class="has-text-dark">
          This is probably the second edition of my personal website. <br>
          I'm hoping to make this more fancy and jazz in the near future, <br>
          so if you're already here <br>
          stay tuned :)

        <p class="is-size-4">"When The Moon's Reaching Out Stars" - Persona 3 OST</p>

        <p> With any luck, this commit won't be the latest one for a long time, 
          so unfortunately this one might not be up for a while, but here's a 
          first notable song. I haven't actually played Persona 3 (yet?), but
          I listened to this song frequently during Spring 2023, and it helped
          me get through some very, very painful computer science assignments.
          There's something about the delivery of the first line, "I've never 
          felt like; so miserable", that got me hooked.
